[Think Stats Chapter 5 Exercise 1](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2006.html#toc50) (blue men)

>> First I constructed a normal distribution cdf using scipy.stats.norm.cdf and the given mean and standard deviation of µ = 178 cm and σ = 7.7 cm. Then by inputing the heights 6’1” and 5’10” (after conversion) into the cdf and subtracting them, I obtained approximately 34.3%, the percentage of the U.S. male population capable of joining Blue Man Group.
